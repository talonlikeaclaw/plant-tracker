# Plant Tracker

In the winter time or when you're busy in the summer it can be challenging to keep track of watering your plants.. That's where **Plant Tracker** comes in handy!
You can add your plants to the web application and keep track of their progression and the care you provide for them.
Mark down important plant care such as watering, fertalizing, repotting, and even add your own custom plant care.

## Development

Currently I want to make something small and simple to begin with to ensure I have a solid foundation for the application.
Once I have the basic functionality solid, I plan to look into using [Perenual](https://perenual.com/docs/api)'s API to get plant care information.
